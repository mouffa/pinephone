On Manjaro in order to adapt Firefox with the mobile environment(either Plasma Mobile or Phosh) you have to install the package `mobile-config-firefox` with the following command

`sudo pacman -S mobile-config-firefox`

On Phosh the package should be already install because Firefox is the default browser.

All the Firefox data are located in `~/.firefox/` and the structure is the same as with Angelfish.
