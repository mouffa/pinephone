# pinephone

All my work on the original PinePhone, most of these information should apply on PinePhone PRO too as well as other project which use the same or similar hardware and software.

Alphabetical project listing:

1) LVGL demos tuned to run on the PinePhone, LVGL is a library to create graphics directly in the framebuffer used mostly by emebedded systems like photocopy machines, automotive applications etc.

2) Quectel EG25-G Baseband Modem, quick instructions on how to work with the modem and the GNSS engine mostly through the AT commands and hardware analysis.

3) Angelfish web browser for Plasma Mobile, an explanation of the cookies, ad-block filter lists, bookmarks, history  etc.
