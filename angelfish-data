Angelfish stores all its data like cookies, history, bookmarks, ad-block filters etc in `~/.local/share/KDE/angelfish`.

Inside this directory there are two directories, `QtWebEngine` and `filterlists` and a database `angelfish.sqlite`.

`QtWebEngine` stores the profiles with their cookies through a complicated directory structure containing text files, databases and binary files.

`filterlists` contains the text files with ad-block adresses

`angelfish.sqlite` is an `sqlite3` database which contains the bookmarks and the history and can be manipulated through the `sqlite3` environment.

Example:
You can dump a database as a text file with the following commands.

`sqlite3` - Enter the environment

`.open angelfish.sqlite` - Load the database `angelfish.sqlite`
`.output your_filename` - Set the output as a file with filename `your_filename`
`.dump` - Dump the content into `your_filename` as text

`.exit` - Exit the environment
